# URL_Shortener
this is a basic url shortener that runs with python and flask that runs locally.
Make sure to have flask and the latest python version.
Make sure to run windows powershell in admin mode to bypass the security policy issue on your system that prevents running scripts. On some systems, 
script execution might be restricted by default to prevent malicious scripts from running accidentally.

To temporarily bypass the security policy Open the PowerShell as an administrator (right-click on the PowerShell icon and choose "Run as administrator").
Then use the following command to allow script execution for the current session:   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

A permanent soltution open PowerShell as an administrator and use the following command: 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
